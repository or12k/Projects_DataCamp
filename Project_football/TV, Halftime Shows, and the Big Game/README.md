#project_football_TV_halftime shows

## Description
The Super Bowl is a spectacle!The sport, the fans, the ads and the  half-time shows.
In this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. 
After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like:

-What are the most extreme game outcomes?
-How does the game affect television viewership?
-How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
-Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?


The dataset we'll use was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files,
one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.

## Project Tasks
1.Import pandas then load the data.
2.Display and inspect the summaries of the TV and halftime musician DataFrames for issues.
3.Plot a histogram of combined points then display the rows with the most extreme combined point outcomes.
4.Modify and display the histogram of point differences, then display the rows with the most extreme point difference outcomes.
5.Import seaborn and plot household share vs. point difference.
6.Create three line plots using the tv DataFrame to compare viewers, rating, and ad cost.
7.Filter and display the musicians for halftime shows up to and including Super Bowl XXVII.
8.Select and display the musicians with more than one halftime show appearance. 
9.Modify the histogram of number of songs performed for non-band musicians.
10.Who will win Super Bowl LIII?
