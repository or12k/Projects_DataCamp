# TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game

## DESCRIPTION
The Super Bowl is a spectacle!The sport, the fans, the ads and the  half-time shows.
In this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. 
After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like:

- What are the most extreme game outcomes?
- How does the game affect television viewership?
- How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
- Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

The dataset we'll use was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files,
one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
